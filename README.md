## Stakeholders
We plan to design a mobile app for a movie theater that allows users to explore the latest movie trends and purchase movie tickets online. To ensure the app meets stakeholders' needs, we interviewed 8 students majoring in communication and/or marketing. We believe they are good representatives of the type of people for whom we are designing the app.

Based on the inverviews, we have identified some core problems that can be fixed with the mobile app:
1. **In-person queue times:** long wait times for purchasing ticket can lead to poor customer expriences. Our app will enable customers to skip the waiting by supporting in-app ticket selling and using digital tickets for entry, which significantly reduce wait times.
2. **Limited customer data and insights:** collecting customer data, such as age and gender, is difficult with traditional ticket sales. This lack of detaiiled information limits personalized marketing and service improvements. The app will streamline data collection, providing deeper insights into user preferences and market trends.
3. **In-theater experience:** improving the in-theater experience is a major challenge for movie theaters. The app will serve as a solution by offering features like pre-ordering snacks with in-seat delivery.
4. **Competition from third-part apps:** third-party apps that selling movie tickets often redirect customers to competitors. This not only results in a lost of direct revenue, but also weakens the relationship with customers. Our app will help retain customers by offering a seamless, all-in-one experience. 

The interviews also suggest the potential goals or needs from stakeholders:
1. **Increase ticket sales:** 87.5% of stakeholders identified increasing ticket sales as the primary goal for the app. A mobile app can attract more customers by offering convenient ticket purchasing, exclusive promotions, and real-time updates on movie availability.
2. **Enhance customer loyalty and engagement:** building long-term relationships with customers is a priority. The app can foster loyalty through features like personalized recommendations, rewards programs, and special offers for frequent moviegoers.
3. **Target customer segmentation:** teenagers and young adults are key demographics for movie theaters. The app can cater to this audience by integrating social features, trending content, and interactive elements that resonate with their preferences.
4. **Improve operational efficienty:** stakeholders seek to streamline operations and reduce costs. The app can automate processes like ticket sales, data collection, and customer feedback, allowing theaters to focus on delivering a better overall experience.

By addressing these challenges and aligning with stakeholder goals, the mobile app will not only enhance the movie-going experience but also drive business growth and customer satisfaction for theaters.

## Product Vision Statement
The mobile app is designed to streamline the movie-going experience by allowing users to discover the latest trends, book tickets, pre-order snacks, and access personalized offers while helping theaters improve customer engagement, operational efficiency, and revenue growth.
